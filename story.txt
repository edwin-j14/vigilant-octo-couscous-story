Connor patiently waited for the professor to start, but something wasn't quite right. The lecture hall had a strange feeling, sending a shiver down his spine. Connor glances up slowly and catches the HUB out of the corner of his eyes. It's alive!

What Connor saw was something that no one on the entire earth had seen until today. A real life alien, just like he had imagined, green, slimy and oddly tall. 

Connor was shocked as he looked on. The alien slowly started to wake up. His experiments had worked. He couldn't believe it. As he watched, the alien began to open his mouth to speak his first words. Connor looked on in shock. As the alien's first word was about to leave his mouth, Connor heard his mom's scream from downstairs "Dinner's ready!!".
